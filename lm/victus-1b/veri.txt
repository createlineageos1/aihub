Hi bro, what's up? Long time no see. What have you been up to?
I'm good, thanks man. Been busy, still coding. You?
Yeah same here. The weather's great today so I decided to go out.
For real? Then let's grab some tea and catch up.
Sounds good. Oh, I started a new show, “Innocent Apartment.”
Ohh, I’ve heard of it but haven’t watched it yet. How is it?
Not bad, super dramatic but the story is really solid. I recommend it.
Thanks, I’ll add it to my list. Any weekend plans?
Not really, just wanna rest a bit. You?
Same here, maybe we can grab coffee or play something online.
Sounds dope. You still playing PUBG?
Every now and then, but I don't have as much time as I used to. LoL isn’t bad either.
I’m on LoL too, let’s play together sometime.
Sure man, we’ll hang out. Did you update the game?
Big patch dropped last week, they added new champs and stuff.
Niceee. I’ll update mine too soon, must be a lot of changes.
How’s your project going? Looks like you’re drowning in code.
Man, it’s a grind, but making progress. Gonna be worth it in the end.
May God make it easy for you, bro. May your code compile in one go.
Ameen, wishing you success too. When shall we meet?
I’m free this weekend, hit me up anytime.
Alright then, I’ll fix my schedule when you ping.
See you, bro! Take care of yourself!
You too, may God protect you.
